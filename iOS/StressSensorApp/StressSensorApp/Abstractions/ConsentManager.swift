        Thank you for partecipating in this study!

        We are currently collecting data from people who suffered a traumatic brain injury, in order to develop a product that may help improve their daily lives.

        The following sections will describe what types of data we collect, and what you're asked from us when agreeing to participate.

        When dealing with daily tasks, individuals that have suffered from traumatic brain injury (TBI) can experience sudden and important mental and physical fatigue, which has been shown to be connected to a prolonged recovery time. For this reason, in order to speed up the recovery of the patient, it is important to keep their stress and energy levels under control, where for energy level it is meant the quantity of physical and mental strength a person has. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing this iPhone application coupled with a wrist sensor, in order to monitor signals such as heart rate and Galvanic Skin Response, and infer energy and stress levels from the acquired data. The inference is done by means of Statistical Learning techniques, in particular, we use a Support Vector Machine model tailored to each user. Early results show that the method can work with high accuracy for some individuals, while underperform for other patients. By collecting more data through this app, our goal is to improve our models and finally produce a product that may help people with TBI.
